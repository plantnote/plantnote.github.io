                  <strong>Q. How to sync data on multiple devices?</strong><br>
                  A. I know most recent apps support automatic data sync between multiple devices with cloud database servers and associated users accounts. However, Plantnote app doesn't support that feature. As a part-time individual developer, it's not easy for me to maintain the database server. I'm really sorry for that but you can transfer data when you change phones with backup & restore features. On the other hand, a local database has some advantages such as fast data access and no cellular data usage. Users may share data on multiple deviceswith backup & restore featuresbut I don't recommend that way.
