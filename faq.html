                  <strong>Q. How to sync data on multiple devices?</strong><br>
                  A. Most recent apps support automatic data sync between multiple devices with cloud database servers. However, Plantnote app doesn't support that feature. As a part-time individual developer, it's not easy to maintain the database server. I'm really sorry for that but you can transfer data when you change phones with backup & restore feature. Users could share data on multiple deviceswith backup & restore function but I don't recommend it.
