                  <strong>Q. How to sync data on multiple devices?</strong><br><br>
                  Sorry but the app doesn't support that feature.<br><br>
                  Most recent apps support automatic data sync between multiple devices with cloud database servers and associated users accounts. As a part-time individual developer, it's not easy for me to maintain the database server. However you can transfer data when you change phones with backup & restore features.<br><br>
